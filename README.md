# Neighborhood Map (React)

## Goal

This is the last project of 2017 Udacity's Front End Web Developer Scholarship lessons. It involves all the courses taught to the students so far. The goal is to create a neighborhood map with at least five locations which are going to have a description. There were no start up code given to the students. But the app was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). By using git and this command, some magic happens and you get your first files that you can work on.

## Purpose

The purpose of this single page app is to use GoogleMaps in conjunction with at least five preferred spots on the map and fetch information about them. The app must be responsive, accessible, UIable :)

## Installation

### Basic installation
You must have yarn, nodes.js 
Git Bash to the source files.
To install all project 's dependencies execute `npm install`.
To launch the development server execute `npm start`.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it.

### Service Worker
I didn't include the build files to the GitHub repo. So to have a Service Worker experience for example offline, git bash to the source files, run `npm run build`, after that `npm install -g serve` and lastly `serve -s build`. Open the browser at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it.


## Contribution

A huge thank you to [Udacity](www.udacity.com) for this great learning experience. It was hard and if it wasn't for the encyclopedia that the internet is, I wouldn't have been able to finish this. So, a huge thank you to everybody who is willing to help a struggling developer out there. Of course, I have to thank the mentor who helped along the way.
Also, a huge thank you to [Wikipedia](www.wikipedia.org) for providing information to my page as well as for [Google Search](www.google.com) for allowing users to search if Wikipedia has no results. A warm thank you to [GoogleMaps](www.googlemaps.com) for providing the map and to [GitHub](www.github.com) for hosting my project.


## Important Notes

 * Please, have in mind that my GoogleMaps API key is **for development purposes only**. It works just fine but it is not pleasing in the eye. I cannot afford to pay to have a license, I am sorry.

 * I have used locations that are not so popular. There is no information in wikipedia for all the places. But I hope this doesn't matter. # Neighborhood_Map-React
